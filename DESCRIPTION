Description: flowcatchR is a set of tools to analyze in vivo microscopy imaging
    data, focused on tracking flowing blood cells. It guides the steps from
    segmentation to calculation of features, filtering out particles not of
    interest, providing also a set of utilities to help checking the quality of
    the performed operations (e.g. how good the segmentation was). The main
    novel contribution investigates the issue of tracking flowing cells such as
    in blood vessels, to categorize the particles in flowing, rolling and
    adherent. This classification is applied in the study of phenomena such as
    hemostasis and study of thrombosis development.
