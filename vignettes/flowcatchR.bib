abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell motility is a critical parameter in many physiological as well as pathophysiological processes. In time-lapse video microscopy, manual cell tracking remains the most common method of analyzing migratory behavior of cell populations. In addition to being labor-intensive, this method is susceptible to user-dependent errors regarding the selection of "representative" subsets of cells and manual determination of precise cell positions.

RESULTS: We have quantitatively analyzed these error sources, demonstrating that manual cell tracking of pancreatic cancer cells lead to mis-calculation of migration rates of up to 410\%. In order to provide for objective measurements of cell migration rates, we have employed multi-target tracking technologies commonly used in radar applications to develop fully automated cell identification and tracking system suitable for high throughput screening of video sequences of unstained living cells.

CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that our automatic multi target tracking system identifies cell objects, follows individual cells and computes migration rates with high precision, clearly outperforming manual procedures.},

RESULTS: The main contributions of the challenge include the creation of a comprehensive video dataset repository and the definition of objective measures for comparison and ranking of the algorithms. With this benchmark, six algorithms covering a variety of segmentation and tracking paradigms have been compared and ranked based on their performance on both synthetic and real datasets. Given the diversity of the datasets, we do not declare a single winner of the challenge. Instead, we present and discuss the results for each individual dataset separately.

It also provides access to Windows and Linux executable files of the evaluation software and most of the algorithms that competed in the challenge.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient, two-dimensional, feature point tracking algorithm for the automated detection and quantitative analysis of particle trajectories as recorded by video imaging in cell biology. The tracking process requires no a priori mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes, motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules, and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells. The present automated tracking process enables the quantification of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as moment scaling spectra.},

@article{Scherf2012,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) have developed into a prime system to study the regulation of pluripotency in stable cell lines. It is well recognized that different, established protocols for the maintenance of mESC pluripotency support morphologically and functionally different cell cultures. However, it is unclear how characteristic properties of cell colonies develop over time and how they are re-established after cell passage depending on the culture conditions. Furthermore, it appears that cell colonies have an internal structure with respect to cell size, marker expression or biomechanical properties, which is not sufficiently understood. The analysis of these phenotypic properties is essential for a comprehensive understanding of mESC development and ultimately requires a bioinformatics approach to guarantee reproducibility and high-throughput data analysis.

RESULTS: We developed an automated image analysis and colony tracking framework to obtain an objective and reproducible quantification of structural properties of cell colonies as they evolve in space and time. In particular, we established a method that quantifies changes in colony shape and (internal) motion using fluid image registration and image segmentation. The methodology also allows to robustly track motion, splitting and merging of colonies over a sequence of images. Our results provide a first quantitative assessment of temporal mESC colony formation and estimates of structural differences between colony growth under different culture conditions. Furthermore, we provide a stream-based visualization of structural features of individual colonies over time for the whole experiment, facilitating visual comprehension of differences between experimental conditions. Thus, the presented method establishes the basis for the model-based analysis of mESC colony development. It can be easily extended to integrate further functional information using fluorescence signals and differentiation markers.

AVAILABILITY: The analysis tool is implemented C++ and Mathematica 8.0 (Wolfram Research Inc., Champaign, IL, USA). The tool is freely available from the authors. We will also provide the source code upon request.

@article{Carden2000,
abstract = {Reperfusion of ischaemic tissues is often associated with microvascular dysfunction that is manifested as impaired endothelium-dependent dilation in arterioles, enhanced fluid filtration and leukocyte plugging in capillaries, and the trafficking of leukocytes and plasma protein extravasation in postcapillary venules. Activated endothelial cells in all segments of the microcirculation produce more oxygen radicals, but less nitric oxide, in the initial period following reperfusion. The resulting imbalance between superoxide and nitric oxide in endothelial cells leads to the production and release of inflammatory mediators (e.g. platelet-activating factor, tumour necrosis factor) and enhances the biosynthesis of adhesion molecules that mediate leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. Some of the known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and diabetes) appear to exaggerate many of the microvascular alterations elicited by ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R). The inflammatory mediators released as a consequence of reperfusion also appear to activate endothelial cells in remote organs that are not exposed to the initial ischaemic insult. This distant response to I/R can result in leukocyte-dependent microvascular injury that is characteristic of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Adaptational responses to I/R injury have been demonstrated that allow for protection of briefly ischaemic tissues against the harmful effects of subsequent, prolonged ischaemia, a phenomenon called ischaemic preconditioning. There are two temporally and mechanistically distinct types of protection afforded by this adaptational response, i.e. acute and delayed preconditioning. The factors (e.g. protein kinase C activation) that initiate the acute and delayed preconditioning responses appear to be similar; however the protective effects of acute preconditioning are protein synthesis-independent, while the effects of delayed preconditioning require protein synthesis. The published literature in this field of investigation suggests that there are several potential targets for therapeutic intervention against I/R-induced microvascular injury.},
